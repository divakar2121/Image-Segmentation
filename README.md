# Cancerous Region Detection with CNN & Shape Analysis
This project detects and classifies cancerous regions in histopathological images using a combination of contour-based segmentation, shape analysis, and a CNN-based classifier.
Segments individual cell regions using contour detection.
Classifies each region as Cancerous / Non-Cancerous using:
Shape properties (area, eccentricity).
A trained CNN model (example included).

#Green contours : Non-cancerous regions.
#Red contours : Cancerous regions.
